# intan-dac-debug #
Code for troubleshooting offline reconstruction of DAC filtered signals.

## Current Step ##
Attempt to accurately reconstruct signal as seen by DAC comparator, using either the recorded DAC output or the recorded corresponding channel amplifier waveform. 

## Next Step ##
Make spike detection ROC and noise rejection ROC. Publish paper. Celebrate.
