# intan-dac-debug #
Code for troubleshooting offline reconstruction of DAC filtered signals.

## Current Step ##
FSM has been implemented in real-time to do spike detection online in awake animal. Just need to characterize the results.

## Next Step ##
Make spike detection ROC and noise rejection ROC. Publish paper. Celebrate.
